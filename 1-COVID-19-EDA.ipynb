A key example to keep in mind is when interpreting plots, numbers, and reports of the *known* number of cases of COVID-19, **know** that this is a function of many things that are *not* the total number of cases, such as **the number of available tests**. The limiting case is when there are zero tests, there are zero known cases; then if many tests become available, there'll seem to be a huge spike in number of cases, even if there hasn't been such a spike. \n\nNate Silver's thread here gives a concrete example in Washington State:\n\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">THREAD:<br><br>Washington state is a good example of the importance of accounting for the number of tests when reporting COVID-19 case counts.

Altair’s API is simple, friendly and consistent and built on top of the powerful [Vega-Lite](https://vega.github.io/vega-lite/) visualization grammar. This elegant simplicity produces beautiful and effective visualizations with a minimal amount of code.\n\nBefore jumping into Altair, let's reshape our `deaths_country` dataset. Notice that it's currently in **wide data format**, with a column for each country and a row for each \"day\" (where day 1 is the first day with over 25 confirmed deaths).
